# DAO Valuation Framework (WIP)

This aims to outline the core aspects of a DAO that are important to contributors (financial or talent)

<br>

## Team / Community

```
Who contributes to the DAO?
- founders
- community members
- investors / speculators

How are tokens distributed between contributors?

Are incentives aligned for all contributors?

Does one group benefit more than another?

Can someone outside the DAO contribute?
- If so, is that process clear, simple, and incentive aligned? 

Is there a steady stream of new contributors?
- if so, do they stick around or do they leave?

What is average contributor lifetime?
```

<br>

## Governance

```
How do decisions get made?
- voting?
- rough consensus? 
- whoever builds it?
- other things that are TBD?

If token voting is used:
- Who controls voting tokens?
- How are those tokens distributed between the DAO's contributors?
- What governance rights are granted to token holders?
- What is the process for token holders to engage in governance?
- What percentage of token holders regularly engage in governance? (voter turnout)

If rough consensus is used?
- Which group of contributors has the most influence over the community?
- Is there a clear process in place to acheive rough consensus?
- Are decisions made in the open, or in a "room where it happens" and then revealed?

If "whoever builds it" is used
- What is the incentive for people to build things for the DAO?
- Can anyone build things for the DAO, or does a certain person or group control the codebase?
```

<br>

## Market

```
What is the purpose of the DAO and/or any products or services it offers? (use case)

What is the target market? (users)

How fast is the market growing? (is user adoption increasing)

Who else is in this market?
- What alteratives are available to get the same features/services as this DAO?
- Are there other DAOs in this market?

Where does this project stand relative to other projects in the market? (leader or follower)
```

<br>

## Token

```
What is the DAO's token? (or tokens)?

What is the purpose of that token (or tokens)?

Are tokens tradeable or assigned to specific addresses?
- If tokens trade, how is price discovery achieved?
  - open markets
  - bonding curve
  - negotiations
  - price pegged to another asset
  - other
- If tokens trade, what is the current token price?
- If tokens trade, how easy is it to buy and sell the DAO's tokens (liquidity)

Who/what controls the minting and burning of each token?

What is the current outstanding supply of that token (or tokens)?

What is the supply schedule of that token (or tokens)?

Does the project's token have liquidity on major exchanges?

Does the project engage with exchanges and data analysis firms to provide accurate and up to date metrics on the project's token?

Is it easy for users and contributors to see the financial data of the project?

How does value (and price action) created by the DAO's token return to members/contributors of the DAO?

Is the price of the project's token tied to the project's ability to fund development?
- if not, how does the project fund development?

What are the drivers of "value" to the DAO's token or tokens?

What is "product roadmap" to drive more value to the DAO's token or tokens?

What is the "growth strategy" to drive more "users" to buy, hold, or use the DAO's tokens?

What would be the outcome of the project if the price of the token went up, and what would happen if it went down?

What is the liklihood that the DAO's token could be classified as a security?
- If so, in which jurisdictions?

Is there regulatory certainty around the DAO and it's tokens?
- If so, in which jurisdictions?
```

<br>

## Valuation

```
Based on all the above metrics, is the DAO's token (or tokens) over or under valued?

How might achieving milestones on the project's product/growth roadmap affect that valuation?

What would be an appropriate price target for the DAO's token (or tokens)?

What would be an appropriate price target if the DAO achieves various milestones on the project's product/growth roadmap?
```

<br>

## Strategic Suggestions

Things the project could do to align incentives for contributors, improve governance engagement/turnout, improve product/market fit, and ultimately increase the value of the token.
