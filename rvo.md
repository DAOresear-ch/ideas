# Rough Valuation Framework

This aims to outline the core aspects of a DAO that are important to contributors (financial or talent)

## Team

Who is involved in the project?

Are incentives aligned for all participants in the network?

Does one group benefit more than another?

Is it clear how someone can contribute to the organization?

## Governance

Does a centralized team control the project, or is it a diverse group of contributors?

How do people acquire governance rights in the project?

What governance rights are granted to token holders?

What is the process for token holders to engage in governance?

What percentage of token holders regularly engage in governance? (voter turnout)

## Market

What is the opportunity?

Is the market fast growing?

Who else is going after that opportunity?

Where does this project stand relative to other projects in the market? (leader or follower)

## Product

What is the team building?

What is product roadmap to improve that product (or products)?

Who is it for?

Does it work?

If it is not built yet, what are the technical risks associated with developing it?

If it is built, has it been audited and does it have an ongoing and meaningful bug bounty program?

Is there regulatory certainty around this product?

Does value created and generated through this product return to the DAO and/or token holders?

## Product/Market Fit

Does the product have users?

Do those users have options to use other products?

What is the growth strategy to attract more users?

Once people are using the product or engaging in the ecosystem do they continue doing so? (churn)

## Product/Market/Token Fit

Does the project's token have utility in (and is it required for) the product?

Are people using the token?

Is the token easy for users to acquire (liquidity)?

Are people holding the token, or just temporarily exchanging it to access a service?

Does the target audience have regulatory certainty around the use of this token with the product?

## Financials

What is the project's token? (or tokens)?

What is the purpose of that token (or tokens)?

What is the current outstanding supply of that token (or tokens)?

What is the supply schedule of that token (or tokens)?

Does the project's token have liquidity on major exchanges?

Does the project engage with exchanges and data analysis firms to provide accurate and up to date metrics on the project's token?

Is it easy for users and contributors to see the financial data of the project?

Is the price of the project's token tied to the project's ability to fund development?
- if not, how does the project fund development?

What would be the outcome of the project if the price of the token went up, and what would happen if it went down?

## Valuation

Based on all the above metrics, is the project over or under valued?

What would be an appropriate price target for the project?

How might achieving milestones on the project's current roadmap affect that valuation?

## Suggestions for improvement

Things the project could do to align incentives for contributors, improve governance engagement/turnout, improve product/market fit, and ultimately increase the value of the token.
